    Hi! I'm,
    <a style='color:#888;background-color:#888'>Anupam</a> aka makeki<br>
    an internet user.<br>

    <h2>about me</h2> Born in Indirapuram, raised and educated in
    Odisha for 9 years, then Gujarat for another 9, now studying in Kerala (i'm pan indian). I remember 
    my first lucid memory is booting a computer my dad had for my elder cousin.
    Even though I had a computer it didn't have internet. So most of my time was spent playing Road Rash, pitfall,
    Zuma; games. No one in my family is a programmer or even remotely in tech, so I was never introduced to that world irl.
    It was when I got internet that my world began developing. But even there, most of my time was
    spent on platforms like kogama playing online games making friends who lived far away.
    Then one day I figured that you could actually make your own games on kogama!!. I didn't end up making
    a front page game, but I remember that excitement of building something I imagine. I made a few buildings, I 
    had the idea planned "gta but kogama" (i didn't have gta and wanted to play it). And I tried and I couldn't do it alone.
    I don't remember the outcome, I probably left it to play fifa (new thing i discovered). 
    I am like little cheerful kid in sandals that thinks of our world as many chocolate fountains. I run around dipping my finger into them.
    If I got access to them, and didn't shy away.
    But somehow, the fountains I dipped my fingers all led to me pursuing computer science.
    I'd say I like vim, zsh, nixos, history, security, consciousness, religion, freedom, my spotify 
    favourites, no bullshitism, mangas, anime, talking to people. If weather is nice I'd say yes to go anywhere with you
    <a href='media/waterfall.jpg'>waterfall</a>,
    <a href='media/morning.jpeg'>morning jogs</a>,
    <a href='media/hiking.jpg'>hiking</a>.
    
    I think I have consumed enough
    entertainment content to entertain a village in 1900s, and I'm actively cutting down it, but movies and literature 
    get a pass.
    Sometimes the code makes it to my <a href='https://github.com/make-ki'>github</a> profile. <br><br>

     <h2 id='projects'>incomplete list of incomplete projects/experiments/bits</h2>
    - wfreq: counts the occurrence of a word in a file. <br>
    - godu: disk usage(du UNIX) but in go, only --bytes is implemented.<br>
    - cyourstory: a software that helps you make choice style stories on a webpage with json input<br>
    - this website?<br>
    - dih: a discord bot that kept taking screenshots of a discord channel, any message starting with dih it sends it to gemini api and shows the result.<br>
    - SuKMaDhe bot: another discord bot that fetched CTFtime information and showed it in our ctf discord server.<br>
    - htmlLP: html link parser, it goes to a website and gets all the links there are in its html.<br>
    - EvoRoute: just implemented bellman ford and dijkstra as used in intra AS routing protocols.<br>
    - wcheck: checks if a list of websites are up or down. Written in go, with concurrent worker pattern. (could end up being a dos generator)<br>
    - urlShortener: if s.makeki.xyz/gh redirects then it works ig.<br>
    - QRNG: actually prng, only qrng if you have fast access to a quantum computer<br>
    - all the lab assignments i genuinely did, most of the people I know around IT have the philosophy of "generate code with agents and we'll actually learn<br>
    later" but idk it just feels weird to do it, im not against that philosophy and that probably is the way the tech future is going to be.<br>

    <b>TLDR;</b> Kid in second year, likes playing around with things, is happy living.
